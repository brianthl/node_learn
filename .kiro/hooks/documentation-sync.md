# Documentation Sync Hook

## Hook Configuration
- **Trigger**: On save of specification files (requirements.md, design.md, ui-design.md, tasks.md)
- **Scope**: All files in .kiro/specs/knowledge-graph-app/
- **Execution**: Automatic when spec files are modified

## Sync Operations

### Requirements → Design Sync
When requirements.md is updated:
- [ ] Check if new requirements need design updates
- [ ] Validate that all requirements are addressed in design.md
- [ ] Update API contracts if functional requirements changed
- [ ] Verify data models match requirement changes
- [ ] Flag any design inconsistencies

### Design → Implementation Sync
When design.md is updated:
- [ ] Update tasks.md if architecture changes affect implementation
- [ ] Verify that all design components have corresponding tasks
- [ ] Check if new APIs need implementation tasks
- [ ] Update performance requirements if design changes impact performance
- [ ] Validate that UI design aligns with technical design

### UI Design → Requirements Sync
When ui-design.md is updated:
- [ ] Check if new UI patterns require functional requirements
- [ ] Validate that interaction patterns are feasible
- [ ] Update performance requirements for new UI features
- [ ] Ensure accessibility requirements are maintained
- [ ] Verify mobile-specific requirements are addressed

### Tasks → All Specs Sync
When tasks.md is updated:
- [ ] Ensure all requirements have corresponding implementation tasks
- [ ] Verify task dependencies align with design architecture
- [ ] Check that UI tasks match ui-design.md specifications
- [ ] Validate that performance tasks address performance.md requirements
- [ ] Ensure test coverage for all functional areas

## Automated Validation

### Cross-Reference Checking
```typescript
interface SpecValidation {
  // Check requirement coverage
  validateRequirementCoverage(): {
    uncoveredRequirements: string[];
    orphanedTasks: string[];
    missingDesignElements: string[];
  };
  
  // Validate consistency
  validateConsistency(): {
    conflictingSpecs: ConflictReport[];
    outdatedReferences: string[];
    missingDependencies: string[];
  };
}
```

### Content Analysis
- **Requirement Traceability**: Ensure each requirement has design and implementation coverage
- **API Consistency**: Verify API contracts match between design and implementation
- **UI Feasibility**: Check that UI designs are technically implementable
- **Performance Alignment**: Ensure performance specs match design complexity

## Documentation Quality Checks

### Writing Quality
- [ ] Clear, concise language
- [ ] Consistent terminology usage
- [ ] Proper markdown formatting
- [ ] Working internal links
- [ ] Up-to-date examples and code snippets

### Technical Accuracy
- [ ] Code examples compile and run
- [ ] API specifications are complete
- [ ] Data models are consistent
- [ ] Performance targets are realistic
- [ ] Technology choices are current

### Completeness
- [ ] All user stories have acceptance criteria
- [ ] All design components have implementation details
- [ ] All UI patterns have interaction specifications
- [ ] All tasks have clear deliverables
- [ ] All requirements are testable

## Update Notifications

### Stakeholder Alerts
When critical changes are detected:
- **Requirements Changes**: Alert about functional changes that affect scope
- **Design Changes**: Notify about architectural changes that impact implementation
- **UI Changes**: Alert about interaction changes that affect user experience
- **Task Changes**: Notify about implementation changes that affect timeline

### Change Summary Reports
Generate automated reports including:
- Summary of changes made
- Impact analysis on other specifications
- Recommended actions for maintaining consistency
- Timeline implications for implementation

## Integration with Development Process

### Version Control Integration
- Tag specification versions when major changes occur
- Create pull requests for significant spec updates
- Maintain change logs for specification evolution
- Link code commits to specification changes

### Review Process
- Require review for specification changes
- Validate changes against project goals
- Ensure stakeholder approval for scope changes
- Document decision rationale for future reference

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Audits
- Monthly specification consistency reviews
- Quarterly alignment with implementation progress
- Annual specification architecture reviews
- Continuous improvement based on development feedback

### Cleanup Operations
- Remove outdated references
- Update deprecated technology mentions
- Consolidate redundant information
- Improve clarity based on team feedback

## Reporting Dashboard

### Specification Health Metrics
- **Coverage Score**: Percentage of requirements with implementation tasks
- **Consistency Score**: Alignment between different specification documents
- **Completeness Score**: Thoroughness of specification documentation
- **Currency Score**: How up-to-date specifications are with implementation

### Change Tracking
- Recent changes across all specifications
- Impact analysis of changes
- Outstanding inconsistencies requiring attention
- Specification evolution timeline
