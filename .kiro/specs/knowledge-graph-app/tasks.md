## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write unit tests for each service and controller
- **Incremental Building**: Each task builds on previous functionality
- **Early Validation**: Test core features (graph visualization, node management) first
- **Performance Focus**: Implement optimizations early to avoid technical debt

### Technology Integration
- **React Native + Expo**: Provides cross-platform mobile development with OTA updates
- **WatermelonDB**: Handles offline-first local storage with automatic sync capabilities
- **Supabase**: Manages authentication, PostgreSQL database, and real-time features
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo**: Powers AI content generation with cost optimization
- **Vercel**: Hosts serverless API endpoints for AI processing

### Risk Mitigation
- **AI Cost Control**: Implement budget management and caching early (Task 7)
- **Performance**: Address large graph handling before feature completion (Task 11)
- **Sync Complexity**: Build robust offline/online sync with conflict resolution (Task 10)
- **Mobile UX**: Ensure touch interactions work smoothly on various devices (Task 13)

This implementation plan prioritizes core functionality first, then adds AI features, and finally polishes the user experience. Each task is designed to be completable by a coding agent with clear deliverables and test requirements.
