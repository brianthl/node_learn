# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Knowledge Graph App is a mobile application that transforms fragmented learning time into active knowledge building through depth-aware mind mapping and AI-assisted discovery. Unlike traditional note-taking apps like Obsidian, this app introduces a unique depth-based node system where nodes at different hierarchical levels can form intelligent cross-connections that users might overlook. The app provides three distinct modes: Bolt Mode for lightning-fast idea capture, Standard Mode for structured cross-file mind mapping, and Rabbit Hole Mode for AI-guided topic exploration. The application aims to replace mindless scrolling with productive knowledge discovery during fragmented time, featuring lightweight mobile-first design with offline capabilities.

## Concept Rating & Validation

**Idea Strength: 8.5/10** - The depth-based knowledge linking with AI-powered cross-depth analysis is a unique differentiator that addresses real gaps in existing knowledge management tools. The three-mode approach effectively covers different learning contexts for mobile-first fragmented learning time.
